                        The illumination initiative, a fund-raising campaign started by NudgeBridge in 2019, aims to support the education of
                        children in Guizhou. We renovated the library, collected donations of books, set up scholarships, and purchased new
                        facilities to replace the existing ones for the local public schools that lack funding. Through education empowerment,
                        we worked with schools to create reading classes, encourage children to read, and support access to books for
                        homeschooling children.

                        Linchang Primary School is the epitome of rural China's education, the school is located in Dafang, Guizhou Province,
                        one of the 100 key poverty-stricken counties in the country.
                    </p>
                    <p class="yahei-font">
                        At present, the school has more than 100 students but only two faculties, despite it being the only public school within
                        5 kilometers, it may have disappeared if it wasn't for the principal's insistence as the school faces serious financial
                        problems.
                    </p>
                    <p class="yahei-font">
                        We were told that due to the poor economic condition, “local government do not have the luxury to pave roads” for the
                        school, therefore students in the school need to spend hours tramping over rough roads to attend the school.

                        The students here are mainly “left-behind” children who rarely get the chance to meet their parents, growing up in an
                        environment without proper parenthood makes them lack the correct understanding academically and socially. To many of
                        them, our volunteers were the only people there to teach basic knowledge of geography, physiology, and sex education,
                        including how to deal with puberty, gender relation, accidental pregnancy, etc.

                        Seldom do people ever care about children's longings for education here, it is more than ordinary for kids here to drop
                        out of school for work at a very early age, for it is the only way the family can survive. The kids here will never have
                        a chance to walk outside of this town; and in the near future, the next generation will be bound by the same reality
                        under this decade-persisting cycle of poverty.
                    </p>
                    <p class="yahei-font">
                        In the hope of changing the status quo, we targeted the children in low-income families and provided them with
                        sustainable financial aid to ensure they can continue their education so that they can embrace the world in the future
                        like any other children in the world. To date, hundreds of students gained the access to better facilities and more
                        books. 5 children from 4 local families have completed their elementary education and had the opportunity to enter
                        middle school for further education under our financial assistance. It is our vision to gather more funding in the
                        future and make the education dream tangible to more kids like them.
